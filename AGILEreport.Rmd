# Geodemographic classifications 

Geodemographic classifications are temporally static, but geodemographics are area-based classifications, and areas are *dynamic*. 

$$ Geodemographic Change = ∑Sociodemographic Processes$$

- gentrification and displacement

- urban decay

- suburbanisation and counter-urbanisation 

Use multitemporal open data as proxies for attributes to sociodemographic processes (gentrification and displacement) to predict geodemographic change pairs. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Method"}
knitr::include_graphics('method.png')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Change pairs"}
knitr::include_graphics('ChangePairs.png')
```

## Comparison of Methods

- Gradient Boosting Machine

- Multitemporal feature selecred variables - 51% accurate

- Change Vector Analysis (CVA) - 48% accurate **BUT** greater speficity of dynamic geodemographic change

# Visualisation

Introduced to new software - QGIS - to develop data visualisation skills, specifically for spatiotemporal data (with TimeManager plugin).  

Mapping <span style="color:gold"> **_golden rules_** </span>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="AngleTime"}
knitr::include_graphics('AngleTime.jpg')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="MagTime"}
knitr::include_graphics('MagTime.jpg')
```

1. Black Background! 

2. Fancy Font?

3. Existing colour packages, **BUT** experiment with blending modes

4. Gifs - great for the lazy reader!  

5. QGIS TimeManager - perfect for quick, easy, effective GIFs, but also for the initial exploration and the visualisation of spatiotemporal data

    - Can I see any patterns?

    - Are they what I expected?

6. Although I am working with spatiotemoral data, I may not always be able to display my outputs in the most appropriate manner (GIFs?!), but static maps can still be effective when using appropriate colours and blending

# Reproducibility

How to better improve the reproducibility of your work via version control (Git)

My current folder organisation:

1. Logical? X

2. Easy to navigate? X

3. A million seperate folders and document revisions? ✓ 

Version control **is** my **friend**

1. Need to rerun a specific analysis? ✓ 

2. Reproducible papers? ✓

3. R? cmd? ✓

4. Online collaborators? ✓ 

5. I have largely been using open data, and use R (with bits of ArcGIS), so these (minus Arc) lend themselves well to reproducibility. But I've learnt how to use QGIS too! 

# Science Communication 

How to improve our communication (writing and presenting) through a series of small exercises to improve our writing process. 

The purpose of scientific writing is to fill a gap in knowledge, and to tell and sell that knowledge with and the scientific community. 

_Brown's 8 Questions_

Focus Focus Focus! 

- Identify appropriate audience

- Defining the purpose

- Creating a story

I had the most productive writing session in that hour and half than I have in the past two months!
